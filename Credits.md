# Credits

Like the status of the mod as a whole as well as DeCiv Redux's credit list, this is incomplete.<br>
Pixel art will most likely reuse other sources for the initial upload.<br>
Some of the icons reuse unsourced images used in either Unciv or DeCiv Redux.<br>
The version of the Mormonism icon used as a Religion Icon was created by Tomatekh on CivFanatics and can be found [at the Civ 5 Customization Wiki's entry on the Tomatekh's Historical Religions mod](https://civilization-v-customisation.fandom.com/wiki/Tomatekh%27s_Historical_Religions).

Unless otherwise specified, all of the following are from the Noun Project, licensed under Creative Commons or Public Domain. Also, if anyone feels like there is a better/more fitting icon out there for any particular building/unit/etc. than the one that is used, I am open to suggestions for replacement icons.
