# Outlaws of the Wastes
A major expansion mod for DeCiv Redux.

# Features

- Barbarians are stronger and spawn more frequently, but give greater rewards for clearing their encampments. (Credit for this concept goes to amfauzn and their "The Barbarians" mod.) In addition to better ruins bonuses, the survivor camp spawn rate is also increased, so players actually have a chance at finding at least one camp in most games.

- Deseret Nation is now a playable faction. Four new City-States have been added, one of which is a preview for a planned new faction.

- Three new national projects tied to the starting three policy trees to aid all of the factions as they try to survive in the early-game.

- New units: Wandering Doctor, Wasteland Patrol, Border Patrol, Expeditionary Force, and Hero of the Wastes, the last one only available as a random camp reward.

- New buildings: Jeweler and Contraband Disposal Site.

- New world wonder: Statue of Remembrance.

- Some of the factions have gained a new UU or UB, or had one of their UBs adjusted.

- Several new beliefs for more diverse religion customization along with buffs for a few of the weaker beliefs. However, several of the more powerful beliefs in base DeCiv Redux have been nerfed.

- Tile improvement adjustments: The overpowered Settlement GI has been toned down somewhat - it no longer triggers a Culture Bomb. Also, Tree Plantations can now be built on Hills and Swamps after discovering the appropriate tech, provided they're not on Desert or Permafrost.

# TODO:

- Restore the traditional Science Victory.

- Revise the policy tree to make policies beyond the starting three + Constitution and Rationalism actually worth taking.

- Add more units, buildings and wonders.

- Add more new factions and City-States, along with more new unique units and buildings for the existing factions.

- And, of course, the bane of all ambitious modders who have no artistic talent: adding sprites for everything.
