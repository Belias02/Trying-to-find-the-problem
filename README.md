# Outlaws of the Wastes
A major expansion mod for DeCiv Redux.

- Barbarians are stronger and spawn more frequently, but give greater rewards for clearing their encampments. (Credit for this concept goes to amfauzn and their "The Barbarians" mod.) In addition to better ruins bonuses, the survivor camp spawn rate is also increased, so players actually have a chance at finding at least one camp in most games.

- The overpowered Settlement GI has been toned down somewhat: it no longer triggers a Culture Bomb.

- Three new national projects tied to the starting three policy trees to aid all of the factions as they try to survive in the early-game.

- New units: Wandering Doctor, Wasteland Patrol, Border Patrol, and Expeditionary Force.

- Several new beliefs for more diverse religion customization along with buffs for a few of the weaker beliefs. However, several of the more powerful beliefs in base DeCiv Redux have been nerfed.

TODO:

- Upgrade Deseret Nation from city-state to playable faction, and add additional factions and city-states. (Deseret being made playable *was* meant to be part of the initial release, but I ran into issues I was unable to resolve at the time. This will be fixed soon.)

- Restore the traditional Science Victory.

- Revise the policy tree to make policies beyond the starting three + Rationalism actually worth taking.

- Add more new unique units and buildings for the existing factions.

- Consider expanding the "hero unit" concept past the Hero of the Wastes found at random in survivor camps/barbarian outposts.

- And, of course, the bane of all ambitious modders who have no artistic talent: adding sprites for everything.
