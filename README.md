# Outlaws of the Wastes
A major expansion mod for DeCiv Redux.

- Barbarians are stronger and spawn more frequently, but give greater rewards for clearing their encampments. (Credit for this concept goes to amfauzn and their "The Barbarians" mod.) In addition to better ruins bonuses, the survivor camp spawn rate is also increased, so players actually have a chance at finding at least one camp in most games.

- Deseret Nation has been upgraded from a city-state into a proper faction, and the city-state of Jericho was merged with it. Three new city-states replace them.

- Three new national projects tied to the starting three policy trees to aid all of the factions as they try to survive in the early-game.

- Three new civilian units, the Caravan, Wandering Doctor, and Seastead Vessel.

- New scout units to assist in exploring, reclaiming and securing territory.

- Several new beliefs for more diverse religion customization along with buffs for a few of the weaker beliefs. However, several of the more powerful beliefs in base DeCiv Redux have been nerfed.

- A new tile improvement, the Artificial Atoll, unlocked at Ocean Remediation and built exclusively by the Seastead Vessel.

TODO:

- Restore the traditional Science Victory.

- Revise the policy tree to make policies beyond the starting three + Rationalism actually worth taking.

- Add new factions and more city-states.

- Add more new unique units and buildings for the existing factions.

- Consider expanding the "hero unit" concept past the Hero of the Wastes found at random in survivor camps/barbarian outposts.

- And last but not least, the bane of all ambitious modders who have no artistic talent: adding sprites for everything.
